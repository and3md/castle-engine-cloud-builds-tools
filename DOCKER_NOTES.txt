## Building our image in Dockerfile:

See:
- https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/
- Dockerfile reference:
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/
- Dockerfile best practices:
- https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/
- See also other FPC Dockerfiles:

The main "caveat" of Dockerfiles is to remember that results are cached.
If a given stack of commands was already executed,
the resulting image (it's files) is used, without executing the command again.
So e.g. "apt-get update && apt-get install ..." is not repeated
if the command did not change,
thus applications are not updated to the latest versions at each "build.sh" call.
This is usually OK (or at least acceptable, as you gain speed)
but needs to be remembered.
